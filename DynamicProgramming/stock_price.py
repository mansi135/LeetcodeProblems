# Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as a list, where:

# The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
# The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that time.
# So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, stock_prices_yesterday[60] = 500.

# Write an efficient function that takes stock_prices_yesterday and returns the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.

# For example:

#   stock_prices_yesterday = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]

# get_max_profit(stock_prices_yesterday)
# # Returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)

# No "shorting"—you must buy before you sell. You may not buy and sell in the same time step (at least 1 minute must pass).

# 122- Best time to buy and sell stocks

"""
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
Example 2:

Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
Example 3:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
